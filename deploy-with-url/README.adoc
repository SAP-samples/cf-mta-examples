# Deploy an MTAR referenced by a remote URL

This example shows how to deploy an mtar that isn't present on your local system.

NOTE: With this scenario, the Deploy Service *will not* check for any ongoing operations with the current MTA.

# Try out

## Deploy the MTA

``` bash
cf deploy https://github.com/SAP-samples/cf-mta-examples/blob/master/deploy-with-url/anatz.zip?raw=true ;
```

NOTE: The referenced MTA archive must be publicly accessible.

## Examine the result

``` bash
$ cf mta anatz ;
