# Deploy an MTAR referenced by a remote URL

This example shows how to deploy an MTAR that isn't present on your local system.

NOTE: With this scenario, the Deploy Service *will not* check for any ongoing operations with the current MTA.

# Try it out

## Deploy the MTA

``` bash
$ echo "https://github.com/SAP-samples/cf-mta-examples/blob/main/deploy-with-url/anatz.zip?raw=true" | cf deploy ;
```

## Examine the result

### List the deployed MTA

``` bash
$ cf mta anatz ;
Showing health and status for multi-target app anatz in org ****** / space ****** as ******...
OK
Version: 4.0.0
Namespace:

Apps:

```

### List app status and attributes 

``` bash
$ cf app anatz ;
Showing health and status for app anatz in org ****** / space ****** as ******...

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
