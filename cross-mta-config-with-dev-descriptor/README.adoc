WARNING: THE SCENARIO WITH MTA.YAML AND (cloud) MBT IS NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL! For modelling with mtad.yaml please refer to link:../cross-mta-configurations[Cross MTA configurations example]

Cross MTA configurations is a feature, allowing for consumption of external string values in the mta(d).yaml during deploy time.
The values are usually provided by other MTAs during their deployments and most-often contain alocated routes mapped to apps in those mtas. Thus a 'service discovery' is achieved at deploy-time.

Since the SAP Cloud Deployment service persists those configurations until the providing MTA is undeployed, they can be used to also hold arbitrary configuration data - e.g. org/space speciffic settings which don't fit an extension descriptor.
