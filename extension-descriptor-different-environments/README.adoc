# Configure same MTA for different environments

Configuration of the MTA is done with the standard approach using MTA extension descriptors. Extension descriptors are complementary files to the main deployment descriptor that provide additional data. They have file extension `.mtaext` and are external for MTA archive `.mtar`. Extension descriptors can be used to provide deployment specific information, for example credentials to external services.

For the test purpose of the example, we will use an MTA containing a simple application, simple service and binding between them.
The MTA will be deployed in DEV and PROD environments using different extension descriptors resulting in different set-ups.

## [Optional] Requirements
- Quota for application
- Quota for different service plans. The example uses service offering "application-logs", free service plan "lite" and paid service plan "standard". You can try it out with a different service offering and plan at your convenience.

## Deploy MTAR without extension descriptors

The first step of the example shows an unsuccessful attempt to deploy the MTA without an extension descriptor.

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml`)

This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` and ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]`:

``` bash
$ cf deploy -f
...
Error building cloud model: Service "my-service" has missing required parameter: service-plan
...
```

Note that deployment fails expectedly because the MTA defines as required the parameter `service-plan` for resource `my-service`, which represents a service instance. This is done with the MTA parameter metadata called `optional`. By default, the `optional` parameter is set to `false`. Setting it to `true` makes the parameter it refers to optional. Thus the field `service-plan` can be left empty in the descriptor.

```text
- name: my-service
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  parameters:
    service-plan: # set the service plan to use
    service: application-logs #set the service offering (label)
  parameters-metadata:
    service-plan:
      optional: false # this is the default value and is implicitly set but can be changed

```

The goal is to make the operator deploying the MTA match the service plan to the specific region, organization and space. For example, in a development working environment (DEV), it's usually the free and small service plan that is used. In production environment (PROD), on the other hand, the service plans used are paid and supported.

### Verify the result

Make sure that nothing is created in the space with `cf apps` and `cf services`.

## Deploy MTAR in DEV environment

This step of the example shows how the MTA is deployed in DEV environment where the goal is to use minimal resources for the application and use a free service plan.

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml`)

That approach uses deployment descritpr `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]`, ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` and extension descriptor for DEV env `link:dev.mtaext[dev.mtaext]`:

``` bash
$ cf deploy -f -e dev.mtaext
...
Uploading 1 files...
  .../my-mta.mtar
OK
Uploading 2 files...
  .../dev.mtaext
OK
...
No deployed MTA detected - this is initial deployment
Detected new MTA version: "1.0.0"
Processing service "my-service"...
Creating service "my-service" from MTA resource "my-service"...
Creating application "my-app" from MTA module "my-app"...
Uploading application "my-app"...
Scaling application "my-app" to "1" instances...
Staging application "my-app"...
Application "my-app" staged
Starting application "my-app"...
...
```

### Verify the result

Check that the app and service instance are created, and service plan is `lite`, defined in the extension descriptor:

``` bash
$ cf s
...
name             offering             plan           bound apps       last operation     ...
my-service       application-logs     lite           my-app           create succeeded   ...

$ cf a
...
name             requested state      processes      routes
my-app           started              web:1/1        ...
```

NOTE: The application has 1 instance, that is defined in the `mtad.yaml`. It uses 1G memory and 1G disk that is default for the platform.

## Deploy MTAR in PROD environment

This step of the example shows how the MTA is deployed in PROD enviroment using  `link:prod.mtaext[prod.mtaext]`. The goal is that app and service can handle more load without performance issues. The application is scaled horizontally on 2 instances and the service uses the stable paid service plan `standard`:

.prod.mtaext
```text
_schema-version: 3.3.0
ID: my-mta-prod
extends: my-mta
version: 1.0.0

modules:
- name: my-app
  parameters:
    instances: 2

resources:
 - name: my-service
   parameters:
     service-plan: "standard"

```

NOTE: The extension descriptor extends the deployment descriptor id `extends: my-mta`

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (mtad.yaml)

This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]`, ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` and extension descriptor for PROD environment `link:prod.mtaext[prod.mtaext]`:

``` bash
$ cf deploy -f -e prod.mtaext
...
Uploading 1 files...
  .../my-mta.mtar
OK
Uploading 2 files...
  .../prod.mtaext
OK
...
No deployed MTA detected - this is initial deployment
Detected new MTA version: "1.0.0"
Processing service "my-service"...
Creating service "my-service" from MTA resource "my-service"...
Creating application "my-app" from MTA module "my-app"...
Uploading application "my-app"...
Scaling application "my-app" to "2" instances...
Staging application "my-app"...
Application "my-app" staged
Starting application "my-app"...
...
```

### Verify the result

Check that app and service instance are created and service has the plan `lite` defined in the extension descriptor:

``` bash
$ cf s
...
name             offering             plan           bound apps       last operation     ...
my-service       application-logs     lite           my-app           create succeeded   ...

$ cf a
...
name             requested state      processes      routes
my-app           started              web:2/2        ...
```

## Deploy MTAR in PROD environment, scale vertically

To handle an increased workload without compromising performance, the application and service will be deployed to the PROD environment using two extension descriptors: `link:prod.mtaext[prod.mtaext]` and `link:prod-scale-vertically.mtaext[prod-scale-vertically.mtaext]`. The application is scaled horizontally on 2 instances and vertically using 2G of memory:

.prod-scale-vertically.mtaext
```text
_schema-version: 3.3.0
ID: my-mta-prod-scale-vertically
extends: my-mta-prod
version: 1.0.0

modules:
- name: my-app
  parameters:
    memory: 2G
```

NOTE: `prod-scale-vertically.mtaext` extends `prod.mtaext` that extends deployment descriptor `mtad.yaml`. It makes an extension descriptor chain.

NOTE: `memory` parameter is not defined in the deployment descriptor, however it is considered during deployment.

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml`)

This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]`, ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` and 2 extension descriptors for PROD environment: `link:prod.mtaext[prod.mtaext]` and `link:prod-scale-vertically.mtaext[prod-scale-vertically.mtaext]`:

``` bash
$ cf deploy -f -e prod.mtaext,prod-scale-vertically.mtaext
...
Uploading 1 files...
  .../my-mta.mtar
OK
Uploading 2 files...
  .../prod.mtaext
  .../prod-scale-vertically.mtaext
OK
...
No deployed MTA detected - this is initial deployment
Detected new MTA version: "1.0.0"
Processing service "my-service"...
Creating service "my-service" from MTA resource "my-service"...
Creating application "my-app" from MTA module "my-app"...
Uploading application "my-app"...
Scaling application "my-app" to "2" instances...
Staging application "my-app"...
Application "my-app" staged
Starting application "my-app"...
...
```

### Verify the result

Check that app and service instance are created, and app has values defined in both extension descriptors:

``` bash
$ cf s
...
name             offering             plan           bound apps       last operation     ...
my-service       application-logs     lite           my-app           create succeeded   ...

$ cf a
...
name             requested state      processes      routes
my-app           started              web:2/2        ...
```

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
