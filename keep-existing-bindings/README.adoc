# Keeping existing CF app service bindings during update
:toc:

## Overview
This example shows how to preserve manually created service bindings, during an MTA deployment, that are created outside of the MTA. A real use case for that is a multi-tenant scenario where bindings are created during tenant onboarding of a multitenant application, and those bindings are not maintained by MTA deployment. 

Modelled via a module level parameter `keep-existing` and parameter option `service-bindings`:
```bash 
modules:
  - name:...
    parameters:
      keep-existing: 
        service-bindings: true
```

## Try out

### Initial deployment
In that part the MTA will be initially deployed when two applications are deployed and one service instance. There is not binding between them.

directly from an mtad.yaml
```bash
  $ cf deploy ./ -f ;
```
or start from an mta.yaml:
```bash
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```
### Manually bind service instance
```bash
  $ cf bind-service cf-app-keeping-bindings dummy-service
  $ cf bind-service cf-app-resetting-bindings dummy-service
```
#### Examine the result
```bash
  $ cf services
Getting services in org ...
name           service       ... bound apps                                         ...  
dummy-service  user-provided     cf-app-keeping-bindings, cf-app-resetting-bindings                                    
```
### Re-deply to simulate update

```bash
$ cf deploy -f ;
```

or

```bash
$ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

#### Examine the result
Verify that  app `cf-app-keeping-bindings` has the binding preserved and app `cf-app-keeping-bindings` has lost the binding.
```bash
  $ cf services
Getting services in org ...
name           service       ... bound apps                                         ...  
dummy-service  user-provided     cf-app-keeping-bindings                                     
```
