# Sharing configuration values between apps

The MTA deployment descriptor allows for fixed or dynamically generated values to be shared between the described entities (modules & resources). For one module/resource to consume exposed variables from another, it has to declare its dependency to it in the `requires` element. As in MTAs apps are defined as modules, this mechanism can be used to share the url of one app in the environment of another:

```yaml
modules:
  - name: providing-module
    type: application
    properties: 
      my-generated-user: ${generated-user}
    provides:
      - name: module-1-provided 
        properties:
          user: ${generated-user}  # the ${generated-user} parameter has an unique generated value for each module
          config: "static-string"
          url: ${default-url} 
    #...
  - name: consuming-module
    type: application
    requires:
      - name: module-1-provided
    properties:
      m1-user: ~{module-1-provided/user}  
      m1-config: '~{module-1-provided/config}-with-suffix'
      m1-url: ~{module-1-provided/url}
    #...
```
NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] and link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] as references for working development and deployment descriptors.

## Requirements
- Understanding how link:../cf-app/README.adoc[Cloud Foundry applications are modeled in an MTA] 

## Official documentation in the Help SAP Portal
- link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/490c8f71e2b74bc0a59302cada66117c.html[Parameters and Properties]

## Deploy

### Deploy from directory
You can directly deploy the built app of this example from the current directory and the modeled link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml deployment descriptor]:

```bash
$ cf deploy ./
Deploying multi-target app archive ********/sharing-values-between-apps/my-mta.mtar in org deploy-service / space ******** as ********...
Uploading 1 files...
  ********/sharing-values-between-apps/my-mta.mtar
OK
Deploying in org "deploy-service" and space "********"
...
Process finished.
```

### Build and deploy from mta.yaml file
Alternatively, you can build & deploy the MTA from mta.yaml. To build and deploy an MTA from a link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml development descriptor], run the commands described below.

First build & assemble the MTA archive:

```bash
$ mbt build
[2020-04-02 23:47:34]  INFO Cloud MTA Build Tool version 1.0.8
[2020-04-02 23:47:34]  INFO generating the "Makefile_20200402234734.mta" file...
...
[2020-04-02 23:47:34]  INFO the MTA archive generated at: ...
```

Then deploy the assembled package:

```bash
$ cf deploy mta_archives/my-mta_0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.mtar
...
```

## Verify the result

Check the actual app url:

```bash
$ cf app providing-module | grep routes
routes:            deploy-service-********-providing-module.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
```

Let's see the generated user value:

```bash
$ cf env providing-module | grep my-generated-user
my-generated-user: u]rPqDU-70y(-E0c
```

Finally, let's see how the second app consumed the provided values:

```bash
$ cf env consuming-module | grep m1
m1-config: static-string-with-suffix
m1-url: https://deploy-service-********-providing-module.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
m1-user: u]rPqDU-70y(-E0c
```

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
