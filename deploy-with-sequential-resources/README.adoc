# Deploy an MTAR using sequential resource processing

This example shows how to make use of the resource parameter `processed-after` in order to influence the order of resource processing.

- Creation of app bindings to service instances: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind

## Modeling

### Service instances having processed-after parameter
Whenever order of service processing is necessary, the `processed-after` parameter comes handy. By using the parameter, we create a sequence of services (an order) in which the services should be processed. 

For example let's say service `A` requires service `B` and service `C` to be processed first. On the other hand both service `B` and service `C` require service `D` to be pocessed first. Service `D` does not require any other service. So the order for processing should be:
`D -> B, C -> A`.

We can achieve this with the following `mtad.yaml`:

....
...
resources:
  - name: serviceA
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    parameters:
      ...
    processed-after: [serviceB, serviceC]
  - name: serviceB
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    parameters:
      ...
    processed-after: [serviceD]
  - name: serviceC
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    parameters:
      ...
    processed-after: [serviceD]
  - name: serviceD
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    parameters:
      ...
....

NOTE: If the parameter `processed-after` is not specified, the resources are processed in parallel.

NOTE: The `processed-after` parameter is supported from schema version 3 onwards. If it's used in a descriptor with schema version 2 or lower, the following message should appear: 
``` bash
Entities from class "Resource" with schema version "2" do not support this operation. At least "3" is required.
```

NOTE: In case two dependencies depend on each other for processing an error will be shown: 
``` bash
Resources "<resource1>" and "<resource2>" both depend on each other for processing
```

NOTE: It is NOT allowed a service to depend on itself. If attempt for doing so is made the follwoing error should be displayed:
``` bash
Resource "{0}" is required by itself for processing
```

## Requirements
- Access to a Cloud Foundry space with quota for creation of service instances.

## Official documentation is SAP Help Portal

### Deploy the MTA
The example can be run with 2 approaches for building an MTA. Both lead to the same result.

#### Deploying from a directory 
This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` and ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]`:

``` bash
$ cf deploy ./ -f

...
Deploying multi-target app archive /Users/*****/*****/cf-mta-examples/deploy-with-sequential-resources/multiple-anatz.mtar in org deploy-service / space ***** as *********************...

Uploading 1 files...
  /Users/******/******/cf-mta-examples/deploy-with-sequential-resources/multiple-anatz.mtar

OK

Use "cf dmol -i ee6a0cf1-3005-11ec-bf71-eeee0a90baae" to download the logs of the process.
...
```

Alternatively, you can first assemble an MTAR using the link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]`:

``` bash
$ mbt assemble -t ./ ;
```

And then deploy the assembled MTAR archive:

``` bash
$ cf deploy multiple-anatz_3.0.0.mtar ;
```

NOTE: See link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] for the modeling.

NOTE: Please adjust the service label and plan values to match the ones available in your environment.

#### Build and deploy
This approach uses development descriptor `link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]` and application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` to build an MTAR archive:

``` bash
$ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
```

The built MTAR archive is then deployed:

``` bash
$ cf deploy multiple-anatz_3.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] for the specific modeling.

## Print the MTA details to confirm the deployment
At any step you can check the created deployment with the following command:

``` bash
$ cf mta multiple-anatz 
Showing health and status for multi-target app multiple-anatz in org deploy-service / space ******** as ********...
OK
Version: 3.0.0
Namespace: 

Apps:
name             requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls   
multiple-anatz   started           1/1         1G       1G     deploy-service-*******-multiple-anatz.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com   

Services:
name       service    plan       bound apps   last operation   
serviceA   auditlog   standard                create succeeded   
serviceB   auditlog   standard                create succeeded   
serviceC   auditlog   standard                create succeeded   
serviceD   auditlog   standard                create succeeded   
```

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:

``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
