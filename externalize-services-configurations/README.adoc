# Externalize service parameters to file

This example shows how to maintain service instance configuration in dedicated json files, apart from the development/deployment yaml.
The content of those files gets merged with the additional configurations defined in the `mta(d).yaml` and gets used as service instance creation/update parameters.


## Modeling

### Service instances
Service instances are modeled as MTA resources of type `org.cloudfoundry.managed-service`. The parameters used for their creation and update can be specified in two places:

- In the `config` parameter of the resource
- In an external `.json` file, referenced in the `path` parameter of the resource

```yaml
resources:
- name: my-service-instance
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  parameters:
    path: config.json      #The content of the json will be taken as a base
    config:                #Those configurations will be merged in the config.json content
      xsappname: "appname-with-suffix-${org}${space}"
  #...
```

NOTE: The content from the external file and `config` parameter are merged. In case of conflict during merging,  the `config` parameter content will overwrite the other.

## Requirements
- Access to a Cloud Foundry space with quota for creation of service instances

## Deploy the MTA
The example demostrates 2 different approaches that lead to the same result.
NOTE: Please adjust the service label, plan and parameter values to match the ones available in your environment

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml`)
This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` and ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]`:

``` bash
$ cf deploy ./ -f ;
```

Alternatively, you can assemble an MTA archive, using the `mtad.yaml` file first:

``` bash
$ mbt assemble -t ./ ;
```

And then deploy the assembled archive:

``` bash
$ cf deploy my-mta_0.0.0.mtar ;
```

NOTE: See link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] for the modeling

### Build and Deploy
This approach uses development descriptor `link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]` and application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` to build an MTAR archive:

``` bash
$ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
```

The MTAR archive is then deployed:

``` bash
$ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] for the concrete modelling

## Examine the result

### List the created services

``` bash
$ cf services
Getting services in org deploy-service / space ****** as ******...
name                                        service            plan
my-service-instance                         xsuaa              application
my-user-provided-service-instance           user-provided
```

### List the user provided service instance credentials 

```bash
$ cf curl /v2/user_provided_service_instances/$(cf service my-user-provided-service-instance --guid)
{
   ...,
   "entity": {
      "name": "my-user-provided-service-instance",
      "credentials": {
         "tenant-mode": "dedicated",
         "xsappname": "appname-with-suffix-deploy-service********"
      },
      ...
```

Notice that the user provided service has the properly merged content in the credentials field.

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
