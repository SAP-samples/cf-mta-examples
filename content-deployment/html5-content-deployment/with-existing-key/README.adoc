# Generic Application Content Deployment With Existing Key

Another option is to deploy Generic Application Content to an already existing service instance, perhaps owned by another MTA. This can be done utilizing the `org.cloudfoundry.existing-service-key` resource type as shown in the `mtad.yaml`.

# Prerequisites
This example requires the service and service key to already be existing. The easiest way to ensure that is to run the link:/content-deployment[previous example] beforehand.

# Try it out
In the current directory execute `cf deploy`. This will automatically assemble the MTA archive and deploy it:

```bash
$ cf deploy
Deploying multi-target app archive */with-existing-key/ui5MTA-with-key.mtar in org ******** / space ******** as ********...

Uploading 1 files...
  */with-existing-key/ui5MTA-with-key.mtar
OK
Deploying in org "********" and space "********"
Detected MTA schema version: "3"
No deployed MTA detected - this is initial deployment
Detected new MTA version: "0.0.1"
Uploading content module "ui5module" in target service "ui5module-ui5-repo-service-instance-credentials"...
Deploying content module "ui5module" in target service "ui5module-ui5-repo-service-instance-credentials"...
Skipping deletion of services, because the command line option "--delete-services" is not specified.
Process finished.
