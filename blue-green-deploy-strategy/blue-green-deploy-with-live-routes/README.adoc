## Execute blue-green deployment using the live routes parameter
During the testing phase of the blue-green deployment, the routes are swapped with idle routes. This is useful for resolving those routes during the testing phase and connecting the deployed applications with each other. However, this could be an issue if the idle route cannot be updated after the testing phase, as is the case with service creation parameters. The idle routes are supposed to be deleted and changed back to normal routes after the testing is done. If you want to provide the routes, specified in the descriptor, as well as the idle one, you should use the provided parameter: use-live-routes. Here is an example:

``` yaml
...
modules:
  - name: hello-backend
    type: java.tomcat
    path: backend.war
    provides:
      - name: backend-idle-route
        properties:
          provided-idle-route: ${routes/0/route}
        parameters:
          use-live-routes: false
      - name: backend-live-route
        properties:
          provided-live-route: ${routes/0/route}
        parameters:
          use-live-routes: true
    parameters:
      routes:
        - route: ${default-live-uri}
  - name: hello-router
    type: java.tomcat
    path: router.war
    requires:
      - name: backend-idle-route
    parameters:
      backend-required-route: ~{backend-idle-route/provided-idle-route}
resources:
  - name: example-resource
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    requires:
      - name: backend-live-route
    parameters:
      service-plan: "lite"
      service: application-logs
      config:
        backend-live-route: ~{backend-live-route/provided-live-route}
```
The route from the first provided section (backend-idle-route/provided-idle-route) will work as a default route, meaning it will be resolved to the idle version during testing and then to the live version after continuing.


The route from the second provided section (backend-live-route/provided-live-route) will always be resolved to the live version due to the 'use-live-routes' parameter

### Try it out

The example will demonstrate blue-green deployment of one MTA comprised of two applications and one service. The first application, called "hello-backend", is used to provide its route. The second application, called "hello-router", requires the idle route. The service requires the live route.
```
cf deploy ./blue-green-deploy-with-live-routes --strategy blue-green --skip-testing-phase
```
In the testing phase the route in the resource will be resolved this way:
```
"backend-live-route" : "<org>-<space>-hello-backend.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
```
In the testing phase the route in the module will be resolved this way:
```
"backend-required-route" : "<org>-<space>-hello-backend-idle.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
```
