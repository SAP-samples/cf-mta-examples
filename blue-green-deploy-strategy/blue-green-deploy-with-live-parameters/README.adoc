## Execute blue-green deployment using live parameters
During the testing phase of the blue-green deployment, parameters ${default-host}, ${default-url} and ${default-uri} receive the "idle" suffix. In other words, these parameters are deemed to be in a standby or inactive state. However, while this is useful for resolving those URLs during the testing phase and connecting the deployed applications with each other, this could be an issue if the "idle" version of that parameter cannot be updated after the testing phase, as is the case with service creation parameters. The "idle" URLs are supposed to be deleted at the end of blue-green deployments. This might lead to functional issues if services dependent on these URLs are not updated with productive URLs unlike the applications. Here's an example:

```yaml
...
    provides:
      - name: provided-router
        properties:
          provided-default-live-url: ${default-live-url}
          provided-default-live-uri: ${default-live-uri}
          provided-default-live-host: ${default-live-host}
          provided-default-live-app-name: ${default-live-app-name}

resources:
  - name: example-resource
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    requires:
      - name: provided-router
    parameters:
      service-plan: "lite"
      service: application-logs
      config:
        router-provided-default-live-url: ~{provided-router/provided-default-live-url}
        router-provided-default-live-uri: ~{provided-router/provided-default-live-uri}
        router-provided-default-live-host: ~{provided-router/provided-default-live-host}
        router-provided-default-live-ap-name: ~{provided-router/provided-default-live-app-name}

```

### Try it out
The example demonstrates blue-green deployment of one MTA, comprised of one application and one service. The application, called "hello-router", is used to provide the live parameters of the MTA. The service requires the live parameters of the application.



```
cf deploy ./blue-green-deploy-with-live-parameters --strategy blue-green --skip-testing-phase
```
In the testing phase the parameters of the resource will be resolved this way:
```
"router-provided-default-live-ap-name" : "hello-router"
"router-provided-default-live-host" : "<org>-<space>-hello-router"
"router-provided-default-live-uri" : "<org>-<space>-hello-router.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
"router-provided-default-live-url" : "https://<org>-<space>-hello-router.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
```
