# Active and Optional Resources

This example shows how to mark service resources as optional/mandatory or active/inactive in order to influence the deployment behaviour.

Orchestration of the following Cloud Foundry features is covered:

- creation of service instances: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html
- creation of app bindings to service instances https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind

## Modeling

### Service instances
Service instances are modeled as MTA resources of type `org.cloudfoundry.managed-service`.

### Optional service instances
If a service instance is not mandatory for a deployment but you want it to be used if availalble, it can be marked as `optional` in the `mta(d).yaml` descriptor:

....
...
- name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  optional: true #default is false
  parameters:
    ...
....

NOTE: The value of the `optional` resource attribute can be changed for each deployment by link:https://github.com/SAP-samples/cf-mta-examples/tree/main/extension-descriptor-different-environments[using an extension descriptor].


### Including/excluding services from deployment 
Service instance resources can be marked as active or inactive to provide finer control over what is deployed. Depending on their status, the MTA deployer will either process or ignore these resources when deploying.

....
...
- name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  active: false #default is true
  parameters:
    ...
....

NOTE: The value of the `active` resource attribute can be changed for each deployment by link:https://github.com/SAP-samples/cf-mta-examples/tree/main/extension-descriptor-different-environments[using an extension descriptor].

NOTE: The `active` attribute can also be specified for resources of type `org.cloudfoundry.existing-service`. In that case it determines if app bindings to the service would be created or not. If an app module has a reference to an existing-service resource via `requires: ...` and the resource has `active: false`, a service binding between them will not be created during deployment.

## Requirements
- access to a Cloud Foundry space with quota for creation of service instances

## Try it out
### Deploy the MTA
The example demostrates 2 different approaches that lead to the same result.

#### Deploying from a directory 
This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` and ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]`:

``` bash
cf deploy ./ -f ;
```

_OR_

You can assemble an MTA archive using the `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` by running the following command:

``` bash
mbt assemble -t ./ ;
```

Then deploy the assembled archive:

``` bash
cf deploy my-mta_0.0.0.mtar ;
```

NOTE: See link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] for the modelling

NOTE: please adjust the service label and plan values to match the available in your environment


#### Build and deploy
This approach uses development descriptor `link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]` and application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` to build an MTAR archive.

``` bash
mbt build -p cf -t . ;
```

The built MTAR archive is then deployed:

``` bash
cf deploy my-mta_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] for the specific modeling


## Deploy with an inactive resource

```bash
cf deploy ./
...
Operation ID: 7c8d9c49-badf-11ea-9455-eeee0a9e129b
Deploying in org "deploy-service" and space "********"
Detected MTA schema version: "3"
Detected deployed MTA with ID "my-mta" and version "0.0.0"
Detected new MTA version: "0.0.0"
Deployed MTA version: "0.0.0"
Service "my-cf-service-instance-resource" is inactive and will not be processed
...
```
The Cloud Foundry application gets created. Since the service's resource is inactive, the service is not created and not bound to the app.

## Deploy with an active optional & misconfigured service resource

Let's enable the resource and mark it optional, but make sure to make the service creation not-possible in order to see how the deploy behaves.
See how this is done in link:active_optional.mtaext[active_optional.mtaext]

```bash
cf deploy ./ -f -e active_optional.mtaext                                                                                                                               6895

Operation ID: 6cc12802-bae0-11ea-9455-eeee0a9e129b
Deploying in org "deploy-service" and space "********"
Detected MTA schema version: "3"
Detected deployed MTA with ID "my-mta" and version "0.0.0"
Detected new MTA version: "0.0.0"
Deployed MTA version: "0.0.0"
Processing service "my-cf-service-instance-resource"...
Updating application "my-mta-managed-app-module"...
...
```
The Cloud Foundry application gets created. Since the service's resource is inactive, the service is not created and not bound to the app.

## Deploy with an active properly configured service resource

Let's enable the resource with an extension descriptor
See how this is done in link:active_mandatory.mtaext[active_mandatory.mtaext]

```bash
cf deploy ./ -f -e active_mandatory.mtaext
...
Operation ID: 6cc12802-bae0-11ea-9455-eeee0a9e129b
Deploying in org "deploy-service" and space "********"
Detected MTA schema version: "3"
Detected deployed MTA with ID "my-mta" and version "0.0.0"
Detected new MTA version: "0.0.0"
Deployed MTA version: "0.0.0"
Processing service "my-cf-service-instance-resource"...
Updating application "my-mta-managed-app-module"...
...
```
The service instance & app get created and bound as expected.

## Print the MTA details to confirm the deployment
At any step you can check the created deployment with the following:

``` bash
$cf mta my-mta 
Showing health and status for multi-target app my-mta in org deploy-service / space ******** as ********...
OK
