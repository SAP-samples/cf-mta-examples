# Partial deployment

Partial deployment is a feature allowing fine control over which parts of the MTA are getting processed by the MTA Deployment service and which not.
One is able to select only certain module(s) and/or resource(s) for deployment. The MTA Deployment service takes care to orchestrate the deployment only for the selected parts and skips the rest.

WARNING: All descriptor validations and dependency cheks on the processed modules are always executed. If the MTA archive is invalid or e.g. an module has a missing dependency (i.e. service instance which should be bound to but does not exist), deployment fails. 

## Usage
To use feature, pass one of the following environment variablest to the `cf deploy` or `cf bg-deploy commands`

|===
|-m <module name>|
Deploy only the module with the specified name.
Note: It can be used multiple times.
|--all-modules|
Deploy all modules.
|-r <resource name>|
Deploy only the resource with the specified name
Note:It can be used multiple times.
|--all-resources|
Deploy all resources.ß
|===

## Partial build & assembly
Only selected moduels would be built and included in the MTA archive. This optimizes built & assembly time, the archive size and respectfully upload & processing time in the MTA deployment service. 

### Partial build

If you only maintain a design time descriptor, the mta.yaml file, for your project or your module should be built before it can be deployed using the partial deployment commands, you can use link:https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/usage/#auxiliary-commands[the auxiliary commands of the Cloud MTA archive builder] to prepare the required artifacts: the modules build results and the deployment descriptor, the mtad.yaml file.

You can find a few tips about usage of the Cloud MTA Builder commands for the partial build in the "Build only specific MTA modules defined in the mta.yaml file and deploy them" section below.   

### Partial assembly
If staring from mtad.yaml, the cf deploy command is capable of assembling an MTA archive just before deployment. The list of modules passed to the (bg-)deploy command is used to select which would be included in the assembled archive.

NOTE: the modules `path` argument has to be maintained for assembly to work. All selected modules should have such pointing to properly build module bits.

## Partial deploy

In the current directory you'll find example cf app payload with the following structure:

* development descriptor: link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]
* deployment descriptor: link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]

# Try out

## Deploy directly from directory, via mtad.yaml 
In the current directory, run `cf deploy -m module-b -r service-2`. This will automatically assemble an MTA archive and deploy it 
```bash
$ cf deploy -m module-b -r service-2
Deploying multi-target app archive */mta-examples/hello-world.mtar in org ******** / space ******** as **** ...
Uploading 1 files...
  */mta-examples/hello-world.mtar
OK
...

Process finished.
```
## Assemble MTA archive via mtad.yaml and deploy
First use `mbt assemble` to create the *.mtar and than deploy it with `cf deploy`.

NOTE: This approach is less efficient, as all modules are included in the MTA archive and uploaded to the MTA deployment service. Regardless that only the selected ones are processed. 
```bash
$$ mbt assemble
  INFO assembling the MTA project...
  INFO copying the MTA content...
  INFO generating the metadata...
  INFO generating the MTA archive...
  INFO the MTA archive generated at: /Users/i076083/git/mta_examples/partial-build-deploy/mta_archives/hello-world_1.0.0.mtar
  INFO cleaning temporary files...
$ cf deploy mta_archives/hello-world_1.0.0.mtar -m module-c -r service-3
  ...
```
## Build only specific MTA modules defined in the mta.yaml file and deploy them

NOTE: Since partial deploymnet requires that all the modules' and resources' dependencies are resolved, we recommend you first build and deploy the complete MTA project (using the `mbt build` command to create the MTA archive (`mtar`) file and the `cf deploy` command to deploy it) and then build and deploy only the changing modules.

The command for building specific modules using the Cloud MTA Builder Tool is: 
```bash
`mbt module-build -m=<list of modules to build> [options]`
```


NOTE: We recommend you to always apply `-g` option that generates also the deployment descriptor, the `mtad.yaml` file. The `path` property for the selected deployable modules in this `mtad.yaml` will point to the build results of these modules, so you will be able to immediately run the partial deployment command as described in the "Deploy directly from directory, via mtad.yaml" section. 


In the examples below we demonstrate how to use the partial build command in different use cases. These examples are based on the project straucture described above and this link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] file.


### Building a single independent module
```bash
$ mbt module-build -m module-b -g
```

### Buiding several independent modules
```bash
$ mbt module-build -m module-b,module-c -g

```
### Buiding a module with build dependencies

Build dependencies are defined via the `requires` property of the `build-parameters` section in the `mta.yaml` file. For more information, read link:https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/configuration/#configuring-build-order[here].

In the sample project, `module-a` depends on modules `module-b` and `module-c`.

You can build the `module-a` module with all its dependencies using the following command:

```bash
$ mbt module-build -m module-a -a -g
```
The `module-b` and `module-c` modules will be built before the tool builds the `module-a` module.

If you change now the `module-b` module and would like to re-build and re-deploy the `module-a` module, use the following command:

```bash
$ mbt module-build -m module-a,module-b -g
```
The tool will build the specified modules only in the correct order.

For the complete information about the Cloud MTA Build Tools partial build options, read link:https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/usage/#auxiliary-commands[here]

Once you have your modules built and the mtad.yaml file generated, you can use the partial deployment command as described in the "Deploy directly from directory, via mtad.yaml" section. 



## Dependency validations

WARNING: When selecting an MTA module/resource for processing, make sure it's dependencies are also selected or are already existing.
 
E.g. If in a clean environment, only a module is selected, without the services it depends on - deployment would fail

```bash
$ cf undeploy hello-world --delete-services -f
... 
Process finished.

$ cf mtas
Getting multi-target apps in org ******** / space ******** as ********...
OK
mta id           version   

$ cf deploy ./ -m module-b
Creating application "module-b" from MTA module "module-b"...
Error creating or updating application "module-b": Could not bind application "module-b" to service "service-2": 404 Not Found: Service service-2 not found. 

$ cf deploy ./ -r service-2 -f 
Creating service "service-2" from MTA resource "service-2"...
...
Process finished.

$ cf deploy ./ -m module-b
...
Application "module-b" started and available at "******-*-module-b.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
Process finished.
```
NOTE: If you expect to redeploy MTA modules/resources multiple times e.g. when doing minor adjustments to them - it may make sense to do a full deployment once and later only update the modules/resources you want.
