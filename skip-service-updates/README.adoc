# Skipping service configurations on update

This example shows how to skip individual service instance configurations when updating a service.

Orchestration of the following CF features is covered:

- updating service instances: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service

## Modelling

### Service instances
Service instances are modelled as MTA resources of type `org.cloudfoundry.managed-service`.
Parameters in the config parameter can be specified to configure the service instance on it's creation or update
The parameters in the skip-service-updates parameter specify which confiuration to not update

....
resources:
- name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  parameters:
    service: application-logs
    service-plan: "lite"
    service-name: "my-logging-service-instance-name"
    config: 
      map: of
      creation: parameters
    skip-service-updates:
      parameters: false
      plan: false
      tags: false
....

## Requirements
- access to a CF space with quota for creation of service instances

# Try out
## Deploy the MTA
The example demostrates 2 different approaches that lead to the same result.

NOTE: you can adjust the service label and plan values to match the available in your environment

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (mtad.yaml)
That approach uses deployment descritpr `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` and ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]`:

``` bash
cf deploy ./ -f ;
```

_OR_

First assemble an MTA archive using the `mtad.yaml` and then deploy the archive:

``` bash
mbt assemble -t ./ ;
cf deploy my-mta_0.0.0.mtar ;
```

NOTE: See link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] for the modelling

### Build and Deploy
The approach is using development descriptor `link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]` and application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` to build MTAR.
Then the MTAR is deployed.

``` bash
mbt build -p cf -t . ;
cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] for the concrete modelling

---
NOTE: The MTA that was deployed has a service with plan "lite"

## Change the service plan

....
resources:
- name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  parameters:
    service: application-logs
    service-plan: "standard"
    service-name: "my-logging-service-instance-name"
    config: 
      map: of
      creation: parameters
    skip-service-updates:
      parameters: false
      plan: false
      tags: false
....

The difference between this yaml and the one used for deployment is that "serivce-plan" is now "standard".

## Try deploying again

Some service brokers don't support plan and/or parameters chaging after creation.
"application-logs" is one such service.
When re-deploying the MTA with the changed plan, the deployment will fail.
To avoid such failures during re-deployment of the same MTA, you can specify the `skip-service-updates` parameter.
When the parameter is specified, MTA deployment will process the service as create only.

## Add a parameter to skip update of the service plan and parameters

....
resources:
- name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  parameters:
    service: application-logs
    service-plan: "standard"
    service-name: "my-logging-service-instance-name"
    config: 
      map: of
      creation: parameters
    skip-service-updates:
      parameters: true
      plan: true
....

## Deploy again

Either with a deployment descriptor or with the MTA build tool.

This message will show up, signifying that the service plan update will be skipped:
``` bash
...
Service plan for service "my-logging-service-instance-name" will not be updated, as the option for skipping service plan updates is enabled.
...
```

## Examine the result

### List the deployed mta

``` bash
$ cf services
Getting services in org deploy-service / space ****** as ******...
name                                        service            plan          bound apps                 ...                 
my-logging-service-instance-name            application-logs   lite          my-mta-managed-app-module    
```

### List app status and attributes 

``` bash
$ cf service my-logging-service-instance-name ;
Showing info of service my-logging-service-instance-name in org deploy-service / space ****** as ******...
name:             my-logging-service-instance-name
service:          application-logs
tags:             
plan:             lite
...
bound apps:
name                        binding name   status             message
my-mta-managed-app-module                  create succeeded   
```
