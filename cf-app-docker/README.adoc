# Deploying docker images as CF Apps with an MTA

This example shows how to model a CF application running a docker image, as an MTA. Cloud foundry container runtime brings the capability to download docker images from a registry as dockerhub and to spin up containers from such. Those containers are managed just as regular cf apps.
Documentated in the CF docs: link:https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/push-docker.html[Deploying an App with Docker]

The actual image getting deployed is of a cf sample app written in go: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/test-app.git 

# Try it out

## Deploy an MTA containing a cf app referencing a docker image.

The example demostrate 2 different approaches that lead to the same result. 

### Deploy directly from directory
That approach uses deployment descritpr `mtad.yaml` :
```bash
$ cf deploy ./
Deploying multi-target app archive /Users/******/dev/repos/ds/cf-mta-examples/cf-app-docker/a.docker.cf.app.mtar in org ****** / space ****** as ******...
...
Deploying in org "deploy-service" and space "******"
Detected MTA schema version: "3"
Detected deployed MTA with ID "a.docker.cf.app" and version "0.0.0"
Detected new MTA version: "0.0.0"
Deployed MTA version: "0.0.0"
Adding domain "my-mta-managed-app.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"...
Updating application "my-mta-managed-app"...
Uploading application "my-mta-managed-app"...
Stopping application "my-mta-managed-app"...
Starting application "my-mta-managed-app"...
Application "my-mta-managed-app" started and available at "my.my-mta-managed-app.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
Process finished.
```
### Or Assemble an MTA archive and deploy it
The approach uses deployment descriptor `mtad.yaml` and Cloud MTA Build Tool uses it to assemble already built binaries in an MTAR.
Then the newly generated MTAR is used for deployment.

```bash
mbt assemble
cf deploy mta_archives/a.docker.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar ;

```

NOTE: See link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] for details on the attributes and environment and deployer parameters used.

## Examine the result

### List the deployed mta
```bash
$ cf mta a.docker.cf.app                                                                                      
Showing health and status for multi-target app a.docker.cf.app in org ****** / space ****** as ******...
OK
Version: 0.0.0

Apps:
name                 requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls   
my-mta-managed-app   started           1/1         1G       1G     my.my-mta-managed-app.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
```

### List app status and attributes 
```bash
$cf app my-mta-managed-app
Showing health and status for app my-mta-managed-app in org ****** / space ****** as ******...

name:              my-mta-managed-app
requested state:   started
routes:            my.my-mta-managed-app.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com            
stack:             
docker image:      cloudfoundry/test-app:latest
```

### Test if the app is working
Find the route assigned to the app in the previous output (of `cf deploy`, `cf mta` or `cf app`)

- Directly open it in a browser as https://<route>

- Or execute a get request from the command line
```bash
curl https://my.my-mta-managed-app.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/index
0
echo $?
0
```
