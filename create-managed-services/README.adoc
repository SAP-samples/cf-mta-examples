# Service instance and binding creation

This example shows how to create a service instance and a service binding for an application to that service instance within an MTA deployment.

Orchestration of the following CF features is covered:

- creation of service instances: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html
- creation of app bindings to service instances: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind

## Modeling

### Service instances
Service instances are modeled as MTA resources of type `org.cloudfoundry.managed-service`.
The service instance can be configured on it's creation or update via the `config` parameter.

....
...
- name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
  type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
  parameters:
    service: logging
    service-plan: free
    service-name: my-logging-service
    config: 
      map: of
      creation: parameters
....


[cols=3*, options=header]
|===
|parameter 
|configuration
|optional 

| service 
| service offering (label)
| mandatory

| service-plan
| the plan to be applied to the service instance
| mandatory

| service-name
| the name of the service instance
| optional (defaults to resource name)

| config
| creation/update parameters of the service instance
| optional (defaults to no parameters specified)

|===


### Service Bindings
Service instances are modeled as in the MTA modules describing the bound apps.
A binding is created or updated when a resource, describing a service instance, is required by an app module.
The service instance can be configured on it's creation or update via the `config` parameter.

....
...
modules:
- name: my-mta-managed-app-module
  type: application
  requires:
    - name: my-cf-service-instance-resource
      parameters:
        config: 
          binding-config: "binding-config-value"
....

[cols=3*, options=header]
|===
|parameter 
|configuration
|optional 

| config
| creation/update parameters of the service binding
| optional (defaults to no parameters specified)

## Deploy the MTA
The example demostrates 2 different approaches that lead to the same result.

NOTE: you can adjust the service label and plan values to match the available in your environment

### Deploy with a deployment descriptor (mtad.yaml)
This approach uses deployment descriptor `link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]` and ready application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]`:

``` bash
cf deploy ./ -f ;
```

_OR_

First assemble an MTA archive using the `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor and then deploy the archive:

``` bash
mbt assemble -t ./ ;
cf deploy my-mta_0.0.0.mtar ;
```

NOTE: See link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] for the modelling

### Build and Deploy
This approach uses development descriptor `link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]` and application binaries `link:appBits.zip[appBits.zip]` to build an MTAR archive.
The built MTAR is then deployed:

``` bash
mbt build -p cf -t . ;
cf deploy my-mta_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] for the concrete modelling

## Examine the result

### List the deployed MTAs

``` bash
$ cf services
Getting services in org deploy-service / space ****** as ******...
name                                        service            plan          bound apps                 ...                 
my-logging-service-instance-name            application-logs   lite          my-mta-managed-app-module    
```

### List app status and attributes 

``` bash
$ cf service my-logging-service-instance-name ;
Showing info of service my-logging-service-instance-name in org deploy-service / space ****** as ******...
name:             my-logging-service-instance-name
service:          application-logs
tags:             
plan:             lite
...
bound apps:
name                        binding name   status             message
my-mta-managed-app-module                  create succeeded   
```

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
