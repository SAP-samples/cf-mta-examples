The repository contains Multitarget Application (MTA) examples for SAP Business Technology Platform Cloud Foundry environment. Examples demonstrate how to achieve different goals using MTAs and what are the capabilities of SAP Cloud Deployment service in Cloud Foundry environment.

Before you start with the examples, please make sure that:

* You are familiar with the basic concepts of Cloud Foundry, such as Cloud Foundry applications, services, service bindings
* You are familiar with the basic concepts of MTA modeling, such as MTA modules, resources and dependencies between them. For more information, you may refer to official documentation for Multitarget Applications for the Cloud Foundry Environment on the SAP Help Portal: link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/d04fc0e2ad894545aebfd7126384307c.html[Multitarget Applications for the Cloud Foundry Environment]

## Requirements

* Access to link:https://sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html[SAP Business Technology Platform Cloud Foundry environment]. There you need to have link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/b328cc89ea14484d9655b8cfb8efb508.html[account]. MTA examples will be deployed in some of the account's organization and space.
* Installed CloudFoundry CLI - ensure that CloudFoundry CLI is installed and working. For more information about installation of CloudFoundry CLI, please visit the official link:https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[CloudFoundry Documentation]. For the examples, CloudFoundry CLI  v8 is  supported.
* Installed MultiApps CF CLI Plugin - ensure that MultiApps CF CLI Plugin is installed and working. For more information, please visit the official link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin#download-and-installation[GitHub Page]
* [Optional] Installed Cloud MTA Build Tool - the tool is used in some of the listed use cases. For more information please visit the official link:https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/[Cloud MTA Build Tool Documentation]

## Limitations

Most examples are generic for link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-controller[MultiApps Controller] that is the standard MTA Deployment service for Cloud Foundry. Some, however are runnable only on SAP Business Technology Platform Cloud Foundry, because of speciffic service offerings or functionalities available only there.
