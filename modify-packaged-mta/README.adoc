# Modifying assembled MTA archives

:toc:
:toc-title: Instructions

This example shows how to manually modify, package, and deploy an already assembled MTA.

NOTE: Such operations are generally prone to errors and failure due to changes in input.

WARNING: If the MTA archive is signed, after modifications signatures may no longer be valid. Depending on the CA and CN, the archive deployment may be rejected.

Please consider using other mechanisms for configuring deployments, such as:

* modifying MTA parameters/properties via extension descriptors (-e *.mtaext) (TODO link)
* refactoring in source code (before initial assembly)
* deploying multiple MTAs in a single space, use namespaces (not yet available)

## Try it
Execute the commands below in the current directory

### 1. Extract the content of the MTA archive
``` bash
$ unzip original.mtar
Archive:  original.mtar
   creating: META-INF/
  inflating: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
  inflating: META-INF/mtad.yaml
  inflating: appBits.zip
```

### 2. Modify the archive

In this example, change the MTA ID as it is not modifiable in an *.mtaext
``` bash
$ cat META-INF/mtad.yaml
  _schema-version: 3.3.0
  ID: a.cf.app
  version: 0.0.0
  ...

$ sed -i -e 's/ID:\(.*\)/ID:\1-with-suffix /g' META-INF/mtad.yaml

$ cat META-INF/mtad.yaml
  _schema-version: 3.3.0
  ID: a.cf.app-with-suffix
  version: 0.0.0
  ...
```
### 3. Assemble the archive
``` bash
zip modified.mtar META-INF/* appBits.zip
  adding: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF (deflated 25%)
  adding: META-INF/mtad.yaml (deflated 41%)
  adding: META-INF/mtad.yaml-e (deflated 41%)
  adding: appBits.zip (stored 0%)
```

### 4. Deploy

``` bash
$ cf deploy modified.mtar
Deploying multi-target app archive modified.mtar in org ***** / space ****** as ******...
Uploading 1 files...
  .../modified.mtar
OK
Deploying in org "*****" and space "******"
...
Process finished.
```
### 5. Check out the result
``` bash
$ cf mtas
Getting multi-target apps in org ****** / space ****** as ******...
OK
mta id                 version
a.cf.app-with-suffix   0.0.0
```
