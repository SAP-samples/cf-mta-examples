# Cross MTA configurations

Cross MTA configurations is a feature, allowing for consumption of external string values in the `mta(d).yaml` during deployment time.
The values are usually provided by other MTAs during their deployments and most often contain alocated routes mapped to apps in those MTAs. Thus a 'service discovery' is achieved at deployment time.

Since the SAP Cloud Deployment service persists those configurations until the providing MTA is undeployed, they can be used to also hold arbitrary configuration data like org/space specific settings which don't fit an extension descriptor.

# Try it out

## Deploy provider MTA
To deploy the MTA providing the configurations, run the following command from the current directory:

``` bash
$ cf deploy provider/ -f ;
```

NOTE: See provider/mtad.yaml for details on the provided configuration values/names/scopes.

## Deploy consumer MTA
To consume the config values, run the following command from the current directory:

```bash 
$ cd consumer ;
$ cf deploy -f ;
```

NOTE: See how configurations are applied in `mtad.yaml` in the current directory.

### Examine the result
Check how the configuration value was consumed:

```bash
$ cf services:
name                        service            plan       bound apps   last operation     broker            upgrade available
myDevService                application-logs   lite       staticapp    create succeeded   sleeve-broker
```

NOTE: The service name came as configuration.

```bash
$ cf env staticapp
...
System-Provided:
{ "VCAP_SERVICES": {"application-logs": [{
    "name": **"myDevService"**,
    "tags": [
      **"myDevService.customized_tag"**
    ]   }  ] }}
...
UserProvided:
property-directly-referencing-the-config: myDevService.directly
property-referencing-config-in-requires: myDevService.inRequiresProperty
via-module-parameter-value: myDevService.inModuleParameter
via-param-in-requires: myDevService.inRequiresParam.inRequiresProperty
...
```

NOTE: those env variable values can as configuraiton

## Consume a different configuration value by using an `ext.descriptor`
```bash
$ cd consumer;
$ cf deploy -f -e ci.mtaext ;
```
NOTE: See how the provided configuration was selected with provider/ci.mtaext. 

Result:
```bash
name                        service            plan       bound apps   last operation     broker            upgrade available
myCIService                 application-logs   lite       staticapp    create succeeded   sleeve-broker     
...
    "tags": [
     "myCIService.customized_tag"
    ],
...
property-directly-referencing-the-config: myCIService.directly
property-referencing-config-in-requires: myCIService.inRequiresProperty
via-module-parameter-value: myCIService.inModuleParameter
via-param-in-requires: myCIService.inRequiresParam.inRequiresProperty

```

NOTE: Provided configurations can also target a specific org & space. This could avoid the need of using an extension descriptor if the configurations are space specific and apply to all MTAs consuming them in that space.

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
