# Cross MTA configurations

Cross MTA configurations is a feature, allowing for consumption of external string values in the mta(d).yaml during deploy time.
The values are usually provided by other MTAs during their deployments and most-often contain alocated routes mapped to apps in those mtas. Thus a 'service discovery' is achieved at deploy-time.

Since the MTA Deployment service persists those configurations until the providing MTA is undeployed, they can be used to also hold arbitrary configuration data - e.g. org/space speciffic settings which don't fit an extension descriptor.

# Try out

## Deploy provider MTA
To deploy the MTA providing the configurations, from the current directory run:
``` bash
    cf deploy provider/ -f ;
```

NOTE: See provider/mtad.yaml for details on the provided configuration values/names/scopes.

## Deploy consumer MTA
To consume the config values, from the current directory:
```bash 
cd consumer ;
cf deploy -f ;
```

NOTE: See how configurations are applied in mtad.yaml in the current directory.

### Examine the result
Check how the configuration value was consumed:
```text
cf services:
name                        service            plan       bound apps   last operation     broker            upgrade available
myDevService                application-logs   lite       staticapp    create succeeded   sleeve-broker
```

NOTE: the service name came as configuration

```text
cf env staticapp
...

    "name": **"myDevService"**,
    "tags": [
      **"myDevService.customized_tag"**
    ]   }  ] }}
...

property-referencing-config-in-requires: myDevService.inRequiresProperty
via-module-parameter-value: myDevService.inModuleParameter
via-param-in-requires: myDevService.inRequiresParam.inRequiresProperty
...
```

NOTE: those env variable values can as configuraiton

## Consume a different configuration value by using an ext.descriptor
```bash
    cd consumer;
    cf deploy -f -e ci.mtaext ;
```
NOTE: see how the provided configuration was selected with provider/ci.mtaext 

Result:
```text
name                        service            plan       bound apps   last operation     broker            upgrade available
myCIService                 application-logs   lite       staticapp    create succeeded   sleeve-broker     
...
    "tags": [
     "myCIService.customized_tag"
    ],
...
property-directly-referencing-the-config: myCIService.directly
property-referencing-config-in-requires: myCIService.inRequiresProperty
via-module-parameter-value: myCIService.inModuleParameter
via-param-in-requires: myCIService.inRequiresParam.inRequiresProperty

```

NOTE: Provided configurations can also target a cpeciffic org & space, which could avoid the need of using an extension descriptor if the configurations are space speciffic and apply to all mtas consuming them in that space.
