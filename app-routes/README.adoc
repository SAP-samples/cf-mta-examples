# Managing CF App routes with an MTA
:toc:

## Overview

This example shows how to model network route mapping to a CF application. The SAP Cloud Deployment service can create, map and unmap CF app routes. 
There a three major ways to do the modelling:

* <<routes>> parameter (*recommended*)
* <<host>> / *protocol* / *domain* parameters
* <<hosts>> / *domains* parameters

[#routes]
## 1. Using *routes*

This is the recommended way of modelling routes, both when using cf app manifests and the mtad.yaml.

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] or link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] in the current directory. Those examples include:

* modelling of two custom routes for a cf app
* consumption of the relevant default/generated parameter values as environment variables

The deployer will read the 'routes' parameter in a way consistent with cf App Manifest files. It will interpret everything up to the first '.' as the host, then everything up the '/' as the domain and the rest (if present) as the path.

### 1.1a Deploy 
directly from an mtad.yaml
```bash
  $ cf deploy ./ -f ;
```
or start from an mta.yaml:
```bash
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

### 1.2 Check out the result
List the routes in the space and look for ones bound to your app
```bash 
$ cf routes 
Getting routes for org  ...
...host                                                      domain                             port   path         type   apps         
   <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix  cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                                  my-app-module
   my-custom-host                                            at.some.domain                            /with/path          my-app-module
   *                                                         wildcard.for.host.at.some.domain                              my-app-module

List the environment variables in your app to see what the routing related paramters were resolved to during deployment
```bash
cf env my-cf-app
...
default-domain: cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
default-host: <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module
default-uri: <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
default-url: https://<org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
firstRoute: my-custom-host.at.some.domain
protocol: https
secondRoute: <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
```

[#no-hostname]
## 2. Deploy apps to hostless domains 
If you want an app to be to bound to a route that is a subdomain of an existing domain without having a host attached, you need to use the 'routes' parameter in combination with 'no-hostname'. Note that 'no-hostname' is a boolean parameter, and must be included with each route it affects - if you have 2 or more hostless routes in your MTA then you need to add that parameter under each of those routes. If the parameter is not present for a route the default value taken will be 'false'.

NOTE: See link:no_hostname/mta.yaml[no_hostname/mta.yaml] or link:no_hostname/mtad.yaml[no_hostname/mtad.yaml]. 

WARNING: The MTA deployer will attempt to create the subdomain if it doesn't exist, but cannot resolve any specific corner cases about subdomain/domain ownership permissions. If the subdomain has already been created - the deployer will simply map the application to it.

### 2.1 Deploy
directly from an mtad.yaml
```bash
  $cd no_hostname ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
```
or start from an mta.yaml
```bash
  $cd no_hostname ;
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```
### 2.2 Check out the result
Note the different routes mapped to the app
```bash
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org <org-name> / space <space-name> as <user>...
OK

name                       requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
my-app-module              started           1/1         1G       1G     host2.some-domain.com, host1.some-domain.com, subdomain.some-domain.com
```

### 2.3 Check out the registered domain
Running the following commands you can verify that one of the attached routes contains no host and has been registered as a domain
```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org <org-name> / space <space-name> as <user>...

space     host                                              domain                                            port   path       type   apps                       service
...
<space>   host2                                             some-domain.com                                                            my-app-module
<space>   host1                                             some-domain.com                                                            my-app-module
<space>                                                     subdomain.some-domain.com                                                  my-app-module
```

```bash
$ cf domains
Getting domains in org <org-name> as <user>...
name                                                                                          status   type
...
subdomain.some-domain.com                                                                     owned
```
NOTE: Upon undeploying the mta, the deployer makes no attempt to delete this new domain. This action is left to the end user if desired

[#host]
## 3. Using *host*
This is a *NOT* recommended way of modelling routes in CF.

NOTE: See link:modelled_with_host_and_domain/mta.yaml[modelled_with_host_and_domain/mta.yaml] or link:modelled_with_host_and_domain/mtad.yaml[modelled_with_host_and_domain/mtad.yaml]. Those examples include the use of single *host*, *domain*, *protocol* parameters

WARNING: When defining both hosts and domains the MTA deployer will generate a route for each host.domain combination. E.g. *4 hosts* definitions x *4 domain* definitions would result in *16 unique reoutes being mapped to your application*


### 3.1 Deploy
directly from an mtad.yaml
```bash
  $cd modelled_with_host_and_domain ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
...
Application "my-app-module" started and available at "my-single-host-value.internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
```
or start from an mta.yaml:
```bash
$cd modelled_with_host_and_domain ;
$ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
$ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
...
Application "my-app-module" started and available at "my-single-host-value.internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
```

### 3.2 Check out the result
You can see that a route with the defined host and domain was created and mapped to the module's app:
```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org ..
space          host                         domain                                  port   path   type   apps             service
<space-name>   my-single-host-value         internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                        my-app-module

```

[#hosts]
## 4. Using *hosts*
This is a *NOT* recommended way of modelling routes in CF.

NOTE: See link:modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mta.yaml[modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mta.yaml] or link:modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mtad.yaml[modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mtad.yaml]. Those examples include the use of *hosts* and *domains* parameters

WARNING: When defining both hosts and domains the MTA deployer will generate a route for each host.domain combination. E.g. *4 hosts* definitions x *4 domain* definitions would result in *16 unique reoutes being mapped to your application*


### 4.1 Deploy 
directly from an mtad.yaml:
```bash
  $cd modelled_with_hosts_and_domains ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
```
or start from an mta.yaml:

```bash
  $cd modelled_with_hosts_and_domains ;
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
...
Application "my-app-module" started and available at "my-single-host-value.internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
```

### 4.2 Check out the result
You can see that the cartesian product of the hosts and routes was created in the form of routes:

```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org ..
space          host                                                      domain                                  port   path   type   apps             service

<space-name>   my-custom-host                                            cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                                 my-app-module
<space-name>   <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix   cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                                 my-app-module
<space-name>   my-custom-host                                            at.some.domain                                               my-app-module
<space-name>   <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix   at.some.domain                                               my-app-module
```

|===
|hostname | domain

| my-custom-host 
| cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com

|<org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix 
| cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com

[#deploy-apps-with-no-routes]
## 5. Deploy apps with no routes 
If you want an app to be scheduled in CF but don't want it reachable via HTTP, you can explicitly use the `no-route` parameter

NOTE: See link:no_route/mta.yaml[no_route/mta.yaml] or link:no_route/mtad.yaml[no_route/mtad.yaml]. 

### 5.1 Deploy
directly from an mtad.yaml
```bash
  $cd no_route ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
```
or start from an mta.yaml
```bash
  $cd no_route ;
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```
### 5.2 Check out the result
Note that no route(url) was mapped to that app
```bash
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org <org-name> / space <space-name> as <space-name>...
OK

name                 requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
my-routless-cf-app   started           1/1         1G       1G
```

[#keep-existing]
## 6. Keep-existing-routes 
Feature is used if you don't want the deployment to unmap existing routes, which are not maintained in the MTA description,
Activated in 3 ways:

* global `keep-existing-routes:true` parameter
* module level `keep-existing-routes:true parameter`
* module level `keep-existing: [routes:true]` parameter
