# Managing CF App routes with an MTA
:toc:

## Overview

This example shows how to model network route mapping to a CF application. The SAP Cloud Deployment service can create, map and unmap CF app routes.
There are three major ways to do the modeling:

* <<routes>> parameter (*recommended*)
* <<host>> / *protocol* / *domain* parameters
* <<hosts>> / *domains* parameters

[#routes]
## Using *routes*

This is the recommended way of modeling routes, both when using CF app manifests and the mtad.yaml.

NOTE: See link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml] or link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml] in the current directory. Those examples include:

* modeling of two custom routes for a CF app
* consumption of the relevant default/generated parameter values as environment variables

The deployer will read the 'routes' parameter in a way consistent with CF app manifest files. It will interpret everything up to the first '.' as the host, then everything up to the '/' as the domain, and the rest (if present) - as the path.

### Deploy
There are two ways of deploying the MTA. The first one is using an `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor:
```bash
  $ cf deploy ./ -f ;
```
Alternatively, you can use an `mta.yaml` development descriptor and deploy the built `mtar` archive afterwards:
```bash
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

### Check out the result
List the routes in the space and look for ones bound to your app
```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org  ...
...host                                                      domain                             port   path         type   apps
   <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix  cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                                  my-app-module
   my-custom-host                                            at.some.domain                            /with/path          my-app-module
   *                                                         wildcard.for.host.at.some.domain                              my-app-module

List the environment variables in your app to see what the routing related paramters were resolved to during deployment
```bash
$ cf env my-cf-app
...
default-domain: cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
default-host: <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module
default-uri: <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
default-url: https://<org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
firstRoute: my-custom-host.at.some.domain
protocol: https
secondRoute: <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
```

[#no-hostname]
## Deploy apps to hostless domains
If you want an app to be to bound to a route that is a subdomain of an existing domain, without having a host attached, you need to use the `routes` parameter in combination with `no-hostname`. Note that `no-hostname` is a boolean parameter and must be included with each route it affects - if you have 2 or more hostless routes in your MTA, you need to add that parameter under each of those routes. If the parameter is not present for a route, the default value taken will be `false`.

NOTE: See link:no_hostname/mta.yaml[no_hostname/mta.yaml] or link:no_hostname/mtad.yaml[no_hostname/mtad.yaml].

WARNING: The MTA deployer will attempt to create the subdomain if it doesn't exist, but cannot resolve any specific corner cases about subdomain/domain ownership permissions. If the subdomain has already been created - the deployer will simply map the application to it.

### Deploy
Using an `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor:
```bash
  $ cd no_hostname ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
```
Using an `mta.yaml` development descriptor and deploying the built `mtar` archive afterwards:
```bash
  $ cd no_hostname ;
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```
### Check out the result
Note the different routes mapped to the app:
```bash
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org <org-name> / space <space-name> as <user>...
OK

name                       requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
my-app-module              started           1/1         1G       1G     host2.some-domain.com, host1.some-domain.com, subdomain.some-domain.com
```

### Check out the registered domain
By running the following commands you can verify that one of the attached routes contains no host and has been registered as a domain:
```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org <org-name> / space <space-name> as <user>...

space     host                                              domain                                            port   path       type   apps                       service
...
<space>   host2                                             some-domain.com                                                            my-app-module
<space>   host1                                             some-domain.com                                                            my-app-module
<space>                                                     subdomain.some-domain.com                                                  my-app-module
```

```bash
$ cf domains
Getting domains in org <org-name> as <user>...
name                                                                                          status   type
...
subdomain.some-domain.com                                                                     owned
```

NOTE: Upon undeploying the MTA, the deployer makes no attempt to delete this new domain. This action is left to the end user if desired.

[#host]
## Using *host*
This is *NOT* a recommended way of modeling routes in CF.

NOTE: See link:modelled_with_host_and_domain/mta.yaml[modelled_with_host_and_domain/mta.yaml] or link:modelled_with_host_and_domain/mtad.yaml[modelled_with_host_and_domain/mtad.yaml]. Those examples include the use of single *host*, *domain*, *protocol* parameters.

WARNING: When defining both hosts and domains the MTA deployer will generate a route for each host.domain combination. For example *4 hosts* definitions x *4 domain* definitions would result in *16 unique routes being mapped to your application*.


### Deploy
Using an `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor:
```bash
  $ cd modelled_with_host_and_domain ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
...
Application "my-app-module" started and available at "my-single-host-value.internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
```

Using an `mta.yaml` development descriptor and deploying the built `mtar` archive afterwards:
```bash
$ cd modelled_with_host_and_domain ;
$ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
$ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
...
Application "my-app-module" started and available at "my-single-host-value.internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
```

### Check out the result
You can see that a route with the defined host and domain was created and mapped to the module's app:
```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org ..
space          host                         domain                                  port   path   type   apps             service
<space-name>   my-single-host-value         internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                        my-app-module

```

[#hosts]
## Using *hosts*
This is *NOT* a recommended way of modelling routes in CF.

NOTE: See link:modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mta.yaml[modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mta.yaml] or link:modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mtad.yaml[modelled_with_hosts_and_domains/mtad.yaml]. Those examples include the use of *hosts* and *domains* parameters.

WARNING: When defining both hosts and domains the MTA deployer will generate a route for each host.domain combination. E.g. *4 hosts* definitions x *4 domain* definitions would result in *16 unique reoutes being mapped to your application*.


### Deploy
Using an `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor:
```bash
  $ cd modelled_with_hosts_and_domains ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
```

Using an `mta.yaml` development descriptor and deploying the built `mtar` archive afterwards:
```bash
  $ cd modelled_with_hosts_and_domains ;
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
...
Application "my-app-module" started and available at "my-single-host-value.internal.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...
```

### Check out the result
You can see that the cartesian product of the hosts and routes was created in the form of routes:

```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org ..
space          host                                                      domain                                  port   path   type   apps             service

<space-name>   my-custom-host                                            cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                                 my-app-module
<space-name>   <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix   cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com                                 my-app-module
<space-name>   my-custom-host                                            at.some.domain                                               my-app-module
<space-name>   <org-name>-<space-name>-my-app-module-with-custom-suffix   at.some.domain                                               my-app-module
```

[#deploy-apps-with-no-routes]
## Deploy apps with no routes
If you want an app to be scheduled in CF but don't want it reachable via HTTP, you can explicitly use the `no-route` parameter.

NOTE: See link:no_route/mta.yaml[no_route/mta.yaml] or link:no_route/mtad.yaml[no_route/mtad.yaml].

### Deploy
Using an `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor:
```bash
  $ cd no_route ;
  $ cf deploy -f ;
```

Using an `mta.yaml` development descriptor and deploying the built `mtar` archive afterwards:
```bash
  $ cd no_route ;
  $ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
  $ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```

### Check out the result
Note that no route(url) was mapped to that app:
```bash
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org <org-name> / space <space-name> as <space-name>...
OK

name                 requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
my-routless-cf-app   started           1/1         1G       1G
```

[#http2-routes]
## Deploy app with HTTP2 route
If you want to enable http2 routing traffic to applications you can use `protocol: http2` parameter on route level.

NOTE: See link:http2-routes/mta.yaml[http2-routes/mta.yaml] or link:http2-routes/mtad.yaml[http2-routes/mtad.yaml].

### Deploy
Using an `mtad.yaml` deployment descriptor:
```bash
$ cd http2-routes ;
$ cf deploy -f ;
```
Using an `mta.yaml` development descriptor and deploying the built `mtar` archive afterwards:
```bash
$ cd http2-routes ;
$ mbt build -p cf -t . ;
$ cf deploy a.cf.app_0.0.0.mtar -f ;
```
### Check out the result
Note that the app-protocol is `http2`:
```bash
$ cf routes
Getting routes for org <org> / space <space>

space    host                  domain   port  path  protocol   app-protocol   apps            service instance
<space>  my-app-route-http1   <domain>              http       http1           my-app-module
<space>  my-app-route-http2   <domain>              http       http2           my-app-module

```

In the example above two routes were created. One of them uses `http1` app protocol for communication with the application and the other uses `http2`.
Keep in mind that if no protocol is specified, the default protocol is `http1`, but if you already have configured an existing route to use `http2` and re-deploy the MTA using normal deployment (not blue-green) it will continue to work this way unless you change it explicitly.

[#keep-existing]
## Keep-existing-routes
Feature is used if you don't want the deployment to unmap existing routes, which are not maintained in the MTA description,
Activated in 3 ways:

* global `keep-existing-routes:true` parameter
* module level `keep-existing-routes:true` parameter
* module level `keep-existing: [routes:true]` parameter

Parameter `keep-existing-routes` preserves the app-protocol as well.

link:../keep-existing-routes[See examples here]

## Clean up resources
It is recommended to stop or undeploy your MTAs when they are no longer needed. In order to do so, run the following command:
``` bash
$ cf undeploy <mta-id> -f --delete-services
```
